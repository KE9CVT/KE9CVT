title:  "First Tastes of HF Radio"
---

I'd like to preface this by saying I am, in *no* way, shape, or form am I a writer. 

So, being the ameteur ameteur radio operator I am, I figured I'd put some neat little pictures and documentation of my progress as a radio operator. My first tastes of HF were in a public park. with a Yeasu FT-891 I got on sale, a Wolf River Coils TIA Special, a cheap(ish) 20ah 12v LiFePo battery, a digirig for digital modes, like FT8--I tried using winlink, but it didn't particularly work out because CAT control is a bit goofy on the 891, and I'm still figuring it out. I have one USB-C port on my laptop, which goes to a DR-891, which then terminates into a USB-B cable for CAT control and a data cable for the 891 that I could not tell you what it terminates in, at least not now. Regardless, I enjoy every moment I'm on the air, though the time I have tends to be very little and very spread out, sort of dependent on how fatigued I am. However, you can catch me every so often on SSB. So far, I've worked various parts of the US, and a bit of canada.
