title: "Welcome To KE9CVT!"
---

-     Hey there! My name is Garrett, callsign KE9CVT, however, most of my friends call me Garry. I'm a sparky by trade, ham operator as a hobby, and I'm *far* from competent when it comes to computer systems. This is a learning experience, completely, and sort of just a general place for me to log out some of the more notable stuff I do. I'm not huge on writing, so a lot of this will likely be based mainly on pictures or videos. If you're in the central Wisconsin area, you can occasionaly hear me on one of the repeaters, on simplex, testing one of my yagis. Occasionally I'll pop out to a public park or area--my favorites being Scray Hill Park or Four Seasons Park--to do a little HF with my Yeasu FT-891.
